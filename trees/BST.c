/* --------------- README --------------
 * A quick note before you begin these questions,
 * it's very strongly recommended that you work these out on pen and paper
 * before actually coding, figure out what edge cases there are, and just
 * work through some of those logically on paper.
 * These questions (tree questions) in particular are typical interview questions.
 * If you're into role playing (or not), try and practice speaking out your thoughts
 * the whole time as you're doing these questions on paper/coding. This is what
 * the interviewer wants to see, your thinking process. It'll also help you maintain
 * focus and pick up errors which you would otherwise miss.

/*
 Your task for this question is to implement the map() function.

The map() function is defined as follows:

void map(BSTree t, int (*f)(int)) { ... }

and takes two parameters:

    t ... an instance of the BSTree ADT (i.e. a binary search tree)
    f ... a pointer to a function mapping an int to an int

The map() function applies f to the value in each tree node, and then replaces the original value in the node by the result returned by the function. The actual function supplied for f must have the type intâ†’int (e.g. like decr()). You can find a skeleton map() function at around line 137 in the BSTree.c file. 
*/

// note: the autotests for this rely on a working findValue() solution

void map(Tree t, int (*f)(int)) {
    return;
}

// Check to see if the given tree is actually a BST
// The rule is that from some arbitrary root, the left child's value must be
// smaller than the root, and the right child bigger
// return 0 if it isn't a BST, 1 if it is
int isBST(Tree t) {
  return 0;
}

/*
 * Given a pointer to a node in the tree, return its in order successor node in the tree, that is the node in the tree whose value is the smallest value larger than the value of the given node. If no successor node exists return NULL.

/* 
   You are given a Tree (t), and two pointers.
   k is a pointer to the 'kth' smallest value you should go to
    E.g. for *k == 0, it should return the smallest value
         for *k == 4, it should return the 5th smallest value
   v is a pointer to an int pointer, the function should finish by pointing to the value
    E.g. You found the kth smallest value, there should be some code which says
         *v = &(t->val)
    Initially, v is set to point to NULL
  
    You can assume the tree is a BST with at least one element and no duplicates 
    and that 0 <= k < n where n is the number of nodes in the tree

/* Find the lowest common ancestor between the noes with values v1 and v2.
   You are guaranteed that both these values exist in your BST and they are
   different
   The lowest common ancestor is defined as the first node which each of
   v1 and v2 share, as they go up the tree. I.e. the root of the whole tree is
   the highest common ancestor. For the following tree:
           
            4
          /   \
         2     7
        / \   /
       1   3 6
      /
     0 
   If v1 == 3, and v2 == 7, then their lowest common ancestor is 4
   If v1 == 3, and v2 == 0, then their lowest common ancestor is 2
